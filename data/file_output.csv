NCT00000104,Does Lead Burden Alter Neuropsychological Development?,National Center for Research Resources (NCRR),NIH,"
      Inner city children are at an increased risk for lead overburden. This in turn affects
      cognitive functioning. However, the underlying neuropsychological effects of lead overburden
      and its age-specific effects have not been well delineated. This study is part of a larger
      study on the effects of lead overburden on the development of attention and memory. The
      larger study is using a multi-model approach to study the effects of lead overburden on these
      effects including the event-related potential (ERP), electrophysiologic measures of attention
      and memory are studied. Every eight months, for a total of three sessions the subjects will
      complete ERP measures of attention and memory which require them to watch various computer
      images while wearing scalp electrodes recording from 11 sites. It is this test that we are
      going to be doing on CRC. There will be 30 lead overburdened children recruited from the
      larger study for participation in the ERP studies on CRC. These 30 children will be matched
      with 30 children without lead overburden. This portion of the study is important in providing
      an index of physiological functioning to be used along with behaviorally based measures of
      attention and memory, and for providing information about the different measures.

NCT00000105,Vaccination With Tetanus and KLH to Assess Immune Responses.,"Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota",Other,"
      The purpose of this study is to learn how the immune system works in response to vaccines. We
      will give the vaccines to subjects who have cancer but have not had treatment, and to
      patients who have had chemotherapy or stem cell transplant. Some patients will get vaccines
      while they are on treatments which boost the immune system (like the immune stimulating drug
      interleukin-2 or IL-2). Although we have safely treated many patients with immune boosting
      drugs, we do not yet know if they improve the body's immune system to respond better to a
      vaccine. Some healthy volunteers will also be given the vaccines in order to serve as control
      subjects to get a good measure of the normal immune response. We will compare the patients
      and the healthy volunteers to study how their immune systems respond to the vaccines.

      There are several different types of white cells in the blood. We are interested in immune
      cells in the blood called T-cells. These T-cells detect foreign substances in the body (like
      viruses and cancer cells). We are trying to learn more about how the body fights these
      foreign substances. Our goal is to develop cancer vaccines which would teach T-cells to
      detect and kill cancer cells better. We know that in healthy people the immune system
      effectively protects against recurrent virus infection. For example, that is why people only
      get ""mono"" (mononucleosis) once under normal circumstances. When the body is infected with
      the ""mono"" virus, the immune system remembers and prevents further infection. We are trying
      to use the immune system to prevent cancer relapse. To test this, we will give two vaccines
      which have been used to measure these immune responses. Blood samples will be studied from
      cancer patients and will be compared to similar samples from normal subjects.
    ","
      Patients will receive each vaccine once only consisting of:

      Arm A: Intracel KLH 1000 mcg (1 mg) without adjuvant, subcutaneous Tetanus Toxoid 0.5 ml

      Subjects ineligible for tetanus may still receive KLH on this protocol. This is especially
      true given the national shortage of tetanus vaccines. Subjects will be eligible for tetanus

      The purpose of this research is to find out whether training at different exercise
      intensities reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) to a different
      extent. Heart attacks and stroke are the leading cause of death in older women. Reduced
      variability of the heart rate and increased dips and swings in blood pressure are risks
      factors that predict the chance of developing CVD as are increased levels of clotting protein

      The purpose of this pilot investigation is to use 1 H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)
      to 1) document the change in intra-muscular lipid stores (IML) before and after a prolonged
      bout of endurance running and, 2) determine the pattern (time course) of IML replenishment

      from a human volunteer and see if we can grow a larger piece of tissue from it outside the
      human body and graft it back into the same person successfully. We expect that this technique
      will work. It has already been tried in patients with burns of the skin who have had similar
      procedures where the skin is grafted back to them. The significance of this research is that
      oral tissue taken from the top of the mouth or palate is in limited supply and leaves the
      patient with a painful and uncomfortable post surgery experience. If we are successful with
      our technique the patient will experience less pain and discomfort from the site that we are

      or palate. In addition, by waiting longer periods to grow the patient's cells we can make
      larger pieces of oral tissue than we could have gotten directly from the patient's mouth.

      To evaluate whether progressive addition lenses (PALs) slow the rate of progression of
      juvenile-onset myopia (nearsightedness) when compared with single vision lenses, as measured
      by cycloplegic autorefraction. An additional outcome measure is axial length, as measured by
      A-scan ultrasonography.

      To describe the natural history of juvenile-onset myopia in a group of children receiving
      conventional treatment (single vision lenses).
    ","
      Myopia (nearsightedness) is an important public health problem, which entails substantial
      societal and personal costs. It is highly prevalent in our society and even more frequent in
      Asian countries; furthermore, its prevalence may be increasing over time. High myopia
      contributes to significant loss of vision and blindness. At present, the mechanisms involved
      in the etiology of myopia are unclear, and there is no way to prevent the condition. Current
      methods of correction require lifelong use of lenses or surgical treatment, which is
      expensive and may lead to complications. The rationale for this trial, the Correction of
      Myopia Evaluation Trial (COMET), arises from the convergence of research involving (1) the
      link between accommodation and myopia in children and (2) animal models of myopia showing the
      important role of the visual environment in eye growth. A contribution of this research is
      that blur is a critical component in the development of myopia. The primary aim of COMET, to
      evaluate the efficacy of progressive addition lenses, a noninvasive intervention, in slowing
      the progression of myopia, follows from this line of reasoning. These lenses should provide
      clear visual input over a range of viewing distances without focusing effort by the child.
      The comparison of myopia progression in children treated with PALs versus single vision
      lenses will allow the quantification of the effect of PALs on myopia progression during the
      followup period.

      The COMET is a multicenter, randomized, double-masked clinical trial to evaluate whether PALs
      slow the progression of juvenile-onset myopia as compared with single vision lenses. The
      study is a collaborative effort that involves a Study Chair at the New England College of
      Optometry; four clinical centers at colleges of optometry in Boston, Birmingham,
      Philadelphia, and Houston; and a Coordinating Center at the State University of New York at
      Stony Brook.

      The sample size goal, 450 children with myopia in both eyes who met specific inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, was attained with the enrollment of 469 children in one year. Children
      were identified from school screenings, clinic records, and referrals from local
      practitioners. Eligible children were randomly assigned to receive progressive addition or
      single vision lenses. Participating children are being examined at 6-month intervals
      following baseline, for at least 3 years, to measure changes in refractive error and to
      update prescriptions, according to a specified protocol. A dilated examination to evaluate
      the study outcome measures is performed at the annual study visits. A standardized, common
      protocol is used at all centers.

      The primary outcome of the study is progression of myopia, defined as the magnitude of the
      change relative to baseline in spherical equivalent refraction, determined by cycloplegic
      autorefraction. The secondary outcome of the study is axial length measured by A-scan
      ultrasonography.

NCT00000114,Randomized Trial of Vitamin A and Vitamin E Supplementation for Retinitis Pigmentosa,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,"
      To determine whether supplements of vitamin A or vitamin E alone or in combination affect the
      course of retinitis pigmentosa.
    ","
      Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited retinal degenerations with a worldwide
      prevalence of about 1 in 4,000. Patients typically report night blindness in adolescence and
      lose vision in the midperipheral followed by far-peripheral visual field in adulthood due to
      progressive loss of both rod and cone function. Most patients have reductions in central
      vision by age 50 to 80 years. Modern-day electroretinograms (ERGs) make it possible to record
      retinal responses from most patients with remaining vision and thereby monitor objectively
      the course of their disease.

      While the natural course of retinal degeneration in the common forms of RP was being studied,
      it was noted that a subgroup of patients aged 18 through 49 who were treating themselves with
      both vitamin A and vitamin E and other nutritional supplements exhibited less decline in ERG
      amplitude over a 2-year period. These preliminary findings, as well as the known roles of
      vitamins A and E in maintaining normal photoreceptor function and structure, prompted this
      randomized, controlled trial to determine whether these vitamins alone or in combination
      would halt or slow the progression of the common forms of RP.

      This study was a randomized, controlled double-masked trial with 2 x 2 factorial design and
      duration of 4 to 6 years. Patients were assigned to one of four treatment groups:

      15,000 IU/day vitamin A

      15,000 IU/day vitamin A + 400 IU/day vitamin E

      trace amounts of both vitamins A and E

      To test the efficacy of acetazolamide for the treatment of uveitis-associated cystoid macular
      edema.
    ","
      Uveitis, an intraocular inflammatory disease, is the cause of about 10 percent of visual
      impairment in the United States. Uveitis may lead to many sight-threatening conditions,
      including cataract, vitreal opacities, glaucoma, and, most commonly, cystoid macular edema.
      Reduction of swelling or edema within the retina depends on the movement of fluid from the
      retina through the choroid. A number of studies indicate that this process requires active
      transport of fluid ions by the retinal pigment epithelium and may involve the carbonic
      anhydrase system. Current treatment of uveitis-associated cystoid macular edema requires the
      use of immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory agents. However, many patients are either
      resistant or intolerant to this therapy. Recent reports suggested that acetazolamide, a
      carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is used to lower intraocular pressure in some glaucoma
      patients, might be safe and effective in reducing uveitis-associated cystoid macular edema.

      Because the course of ocular inflammatory disease can be variable, a double-masked,
      randomized, crossover trial was designed to test the efficacy of acetazolamide compared with
      a placebo for the treatment of uveitis-associated cystoid macular edema. Randomized adult
      patients received either oral acetazolamide sodium 500 mg or a matched placebo every 12 hours
      for the first 4 weeks of the study. Children 8 years of age or older received a lesser dose
      based on body weight. Following a 4-week period, during which no medication was given,
      patients then received a 4-week course of the opposite medication. Primary end points
      included reduction in cystoid macular edema (graded on fluorescein angiography) and
      improvement in visual acuity (measured on standardized Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy
      Study [ETDRS] charts). Laser acuity was also assessed as a secondary outcome variable.
      Adverse effects of the acetazolamide therapy were monitored by clinical and laboratory
      examinations.

      A total of 40 patients were recruited for the study. Patients were seen at the beginning of
      the study for baseline measurements and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after enrollment into the

    ","
      Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited retinal degenerations with a worldwide
      prevalence of approximately 1 in 4,000. Patients typically report night blindness and
      difficulty with midperipheral visual field in adolescence. As the condition progresses, they
      lose far peripheral visual field. Most patients have reductions in central vision by age 50
      to 80 years. Based on electroretinograms (ERGs), the course of the disease can be slowed on
      average among adults on 15,000 IU/day of vitamin A palmitate. While conducting the trial on
      the effects of vitamin A on RP, it became apparent that another substance in the diet could
      be affecting the course of the disease. This prompted the present randomized, controlled

      recovery usually begins within 4 weeks, and marked recovery occurs within 1 to 3 months in
      most patients. Although clinical improvement is the rule, not all patients recover fully, and
      many are left with residual symptoms. Although there are limited pathological studies in
      inflammatory ON, the pathological changes are thought to be virtually identical with those
      seen in MS, with disruption of the blood-nerve (brain) barrier; primary demyelination with
      axonal sparing; variable degrees of lymphocytic infiltration; an abundance of macrophages
      around the inflammatory demyelination lesion; various degrees of remyelination; and, later,
      oligodendrocyte loss, axonal loss, and gliosis.

      Remyelination by oligodendrocytes occurs early in the MS lesion, as documented by myelin
      sheaths that are abnormally thin relative to axon diameter. These thin myelin sheaths are
      often seen prominently at the edge of demyelinated plaques. A recent series of studies has
      shown that within weeks of the initial event, there is extensive oligodendrocyte regeneration
      and remyelination. These immature oligodendrocytes express a series of developmentally
      restricted antigens. This finding has been interpreted to suggest that the cells that
      repopulate the acute plaque and that affect remyelination are newly generated and not
      residual, mature oligodendrocytes. These observations support the possibility that factors
      that promote remyelination could be used to improve clinical recovery in ON and MS.

      Work at the Mayo Clinic, has shown that both immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed against spinal
      cord antigens and purified polyclonal mouse IgG administered systemically promote extensive
      remyelination in SJL mice chronically infected with Theiler's virus. In addition, tissue
      culture studies suggest that IgG directed against CNS components may promote oligodendroglial
      proliferation and differentiation. Thus, experimental evidence exists for the concept that
      immunoglobulins may stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocytes. It
      is possible that myelin components on the surface of oligodendrocytes could function as
      receptors or components of receptors. Antibodies could mimic endogenous ligands, thereby
      inducing the proliferation or differentiation of these cells.

      In a preliminary, open-label pilot study of patients with chronic, steroid-unresponsive ON,
      Drs. van Engelen, Hommes, and colleagues suggested that improvement in visual recovery could
      be seen following IgG treatment in patients with chronic, stable ON. These encouraging but
      preliminary basic and clinical studies have prompted us to design a double-blind and
      placebo-controlled clinical trial of IVIg in patients with recently acquired but apparently
      permanent muscle paralysis from MS (NS31506) and to develop this NEI-funded ON study
      (U10EY1096301).

      In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, 60 patients were
      assigned to receive either IVIg or a placebo over a period of 3 months. In order to be
      eligible, patients who meet the inclusion criteria needed to have a stable loss of visual
      function (unchanged between the pre-enrollment screening visit and the enrollment visit). All
      patients wre re-examined at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, with the primary outcome being the impact
      of treatment on visual acuity at 6 months as determined by measurements on a retroilluminated
      Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart at 4 meters.

      One group of patients received 0.4 g/kg Gammimmune N intravenously daily for 5 days, and
      thereafter once a month for 3 months (total: eight infusions). The other group of patients
      received infusions of 0.1 percent human serum albumin in 10 percent maltose (placebo)
      according to the identical protocol used for Gammimmune N.

      The primary outcome measure was improvement in Logmar visual acuity by an average of 0.2 at 6
      months. The secondary outcome measures included change in visual acuity at 3, 9, and 12
      months, as determined on a retroilluminated ETDRS chart at 4 meters; change in visual fields
      at 6 and 12 months; change in visual evoked responses at 3, 6, and 12 months; and change in
      neurological examination (EDSS, FS, AI) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

NCT00000118,Ganciclovir Implant Study for Cytomegalovirus Retinitis,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,"
      To determine the therapeutic efficacy of a sustained-release intraocular drug delivery system
      for ganciclovir therapy of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with acquired
      immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
    ","
      CMV retinitis occurs in 20 to 30 percent of patients with AIDS and is the leading cause of
      visual loss in these patients. At present, ganciclovir and foscarnet are the only drugs that
      have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CMV
      retinitis. The therapeutic regimen for each drug consists of a 2-week induction period
      followed by daily maintenance intravenous infusions. Unfortunately, CMV retinitis usually
      progresses despite daily maintenance therapy, and both drugs are associated with significant
      systemic toxicity that often limits their therapeutic usefulness. As an alternative to
      intravenous administration, direct intravitreal injections of ganciclovir have been studied
      and have been shown to be effective in delaying the progression of CMV retinitis. The short
      half-life of the drug, however, necessitates one to two intraocular injections a week to
      maintain therapeutic levels. Widespread adoption of this technique has been limited because
      of the logistical difficulties and inherent risks associated with numerous intravitreal
      injections.

      A drug delivery system capable of continuous delivery of ganciclovir into the vitreous cavity
      has been developed. The device consists of a 6-mg pellet of ganciclovir that is coated with a
      series of polymers with variable permeability to ganciclovir. The device is surgically
      implanted through the pars plana.

      Thirty eyes of 26 patients with unilateral non-sight-threatening CMV retinitis were randomly
      assigned to one of two groups: (1) immediate therapy with a device designed to release
      ganciclovir into the vitreous cavity a over approximately a 4-month period or (2) deferred
      treatment. In patients with bilateral non-sight-threatening CMV retinitis, one eye was
      randomly assigned to receive a ganciclovir implant with the other eye assigned to deferred
      treatment. (Note: The original trial design included a third randomized arm using a 2 ug/hour
      device. This arm was dropped for logistical reasons after enrolling two patients.)

      Patients assigned to immediate treatment underwent surgery to implant the ganciclovir device
      within 48 hours of enrollment and baseline photographs. Postoperatively, patients were
      evaluated the next day, weekly for 2 weeks, and then every 2 weeks until progression of CMV
      retinitis occurred. At each examination, in both eyes, visual acuity with current correction
      and best correction was determined using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study eye
      charts; intraocular pressure was determined; evidence of inflammation or cataract was
      evaluated; and all retinal findings were documented. Any adverse event considered even
      possibly related to the device or to the implantation procedure was documented. Standardized
      nine-field fundus photographs were taken at each 2-week visit. The ganciclovir implant was
      exchanged at 32 weeks or earlier if progression of CMV retinitis occurred.

      The primary end point was time to CMV retinitis progression, defined as the time (days) from
      initiating therapy until the advancement of 750-um over a 750 um front of any border of any
      lesion was observed. Standardized nine-field photographs were taken at 2-week intervals and
      analyzed in a masked fashion by the Fundus Photograph Reading Center to determine evidence of
      CMV retinitis progression.

      Secondary end points included time to development of CMV retinitis in the contralateral eye,
      time to development of visceral CMV, and time to death.

NCT00000119,Safety and Efficacy of a Heparin-Coated Intraocular Lens in Uveitis,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,"
      To investigate the safety and efficacy of a heparin surface-modified intraocular lens in
      patients with uveitis undergoing cataract surgery.

      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraocular lens implantation in patients with severe
      uveitis.
    ","
      Patients with uveitis are at high risk for significant complications following cataract
      surgery with intraocular lens implantation. Complications may result from the surgery itself
      or may develop after surgery as a result of the intraocular lens. Complications related to
      intraocular lens implantation include iris adhesions to the intraocular lens, which can
      result in lens capture; cellular deposits on the surface of the lens that can obscure vision;
      and uveitis. Recent studies have identified giant cells on the anterior surface of
      intraocular lenses in some patients with uveitis, appearing to indicate an intraocular
      lens-induced inflammatory response. Some of these patients have required multiple YAG laser
      procedures to remove these deposits.

      Modification of the surface of the intraocular lens with a layer of heparin may provide a
      more biocompatible surface. Preclinical studies have shown a reduction in the degree of
      postoperative complications with the heparin surface-modified intraocular lens compared with
      an unmodified lens. Although retrospective case series have examined the use of heparin
      surface-modified intraocular lenses in patients with uveitis, a randomized, controlled
      clinical trial has not been performed.

      This is a randomized clinical trial examining the safety and efficacy of the heparin
      surface-modified intraocular lens in patients with uveitis. Eighty patients with a history of
      uveitis in an eye requiring cataract surgery will be randomized to receive a heparin
      surface-modified intraocular lens or the same model of intraocular lens without surface
      modification. The primary end point of the study will be the development of cellular deposits
      on the anterior surface of the intraocular lens 1 year after surgery. These cellular deposits
      will be assessed by a masked grader using standard photographs. Secondary end points will
      include visual acuity, intraocular inflammation, development of anterior and posterior
      synechiae, and corneal endothelial cell counts.

NCT00000120,Clinical Trial of Eye Prophylaxis in the Newborn,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,"
      To compare the effectiveness of silver nitrate drops, erythromycin ointment, or no medication
      in preventing neonatal conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and other eye
      infections.

      To compare side effects of the two prophylactic agents.
    ","
      Sexually transmitted diseases are a major cause of neonatal eye infections. All 50 States
      require some eye treatment at birth to prevent gonorrheal eye infections. Approximately 3 to
      4 million Americans acquire a genital chlamydial infection each year, and more than 150,000
      infants are born to mothers with chlamydial infections. These infants are at high risk of
      developing conjunctivitis and pneumonia.

      In the State of Washington, one of three treatments is presently required by law to help
      prevent gonorrheal eye infection in newborn babies: 1 percent silver nitrate drops,
      erythromycin ointment, or tetracycline ointment. Although all three treatments appear to
      prevent eye infections from gonorrhea, silver nitrate and erythromycin may also partially
      prevent chlamydial conjunctivitis. However, silver nitrate may irritate and damage the eyes
      of newborns.

      If it is not known whether the mother is infected, it may be better not to give the drugs
      routinely. It could not be clearly established from the medical literature whether the risk
      to infants from no treatment was higher or lower than the risk from receiving a prophylactic
      agent. Many parents at low risk for gonorrhea prefer that no prophylaxis be given to their
      newborns. Moreover, Great Britain, which used no eye prophylactic agents for newborns for the
      25 years preceding the study, has rates of neonatal conjunctivitis similar to those in the
      United States. For these reasons, the Washington State Board of Health granted this study an
      exemption from the State law to allow the investigators to evaluate scientifically the risks
      and benefits of no treatment.

      The study was a randomized, double-masked clinical trials planned to include 1,200 infants
      born over 3 years. The trial compared the efficacy of two treatment regimens (silver nitrate
      and erythromycin) in two treatment groups to the outcomes in a control group receiving no
      prophylaxis. (Erythromycin was chosen over tetracycline as the antibiotic in this study
      because it is more commonly used in the United States for ocular prophylaxis.)

      Women were recruited from the University of Washington Medical Center-associated obstetric
      units. Among the 2,577 women eligible for possible participation, 758 enrolled. Of these
      participants, 89 were not randomized. Among the 669 randomized women, 39 were not available
      for personal observation. These 39 were equally distributed among the three prophylaxis
      groups. In the final participant group, the infants of 630 women were evaluable.

      The infants were randomly assigned to one of these three groups in the delivery room. Infants
      without conjunctivitis were monitored for 2 months after delivery. Infants who developed
      conjunctivitis were monitored for 2 months after successful treatment of their infection. The
      study included extensive efforts to determine the etiology of the conjunctivitis and to find
      nasolacrimal duct obstruction.

      To determine whether the preoperative use of prisms in eyeglasses can improve the outcome of
      surgery for acquired esotropia, a type of strabismus.

      To determine whether patients who respond to prism adaptation by developing a new stable
      angle of -deviation have a better surgical result than do patients who do not respond to
      prism adaptation.

      To determine whether patients who respond to prism adaptation are more accurately corrected
      by operating for the prism-adapted angle or the original angle of deviation.

      To determine the usefulness of certain input variables (e.g., age at the time of surgery,
      size of the deviation, visual acuity, binocular function, refractive error) in predicting
      which patients are more likely to benefit from prism adaptation.
    ","
      Acquired esotropia (crossed eyes that develop after a child reaches the age of 6 months)
      accounts for 25 percent of all patients with misaligned eyes. Surgery to correct esotropia is
      done primarily to attain functional use of the two eyes together. The cosmetic aspect of the
      surgery is secondary. In 40 to 50 percent of cases, more than one operation is needed to
      accomplish the primary goal, and in some cases even three and four operations are needed.

      Preliminary studies from two eye care centers reported that the use of prisms on eyeglasses
      for about a month before surgery led to good results after a single operation in more than 90
      percent of patients. These uncontrolled preliminary studies pointed to the need for a
      multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial designed to prove or disprove
      scientifically the beneficial effect of prisms.

      The Prism Adaptation Study was a double randomization trial involving 286 patients.
      Three-fifths of the patients were randomly selected for prism adaptation before surgery. Of
      the patients who responded to the prisms, one-half were randomly selected to have surgery
      based on the amount of prism required to stabilize the deviation, and the other half had
      surgery based on the amount of esotropia originally measured. Patients who did not respond to
      the prisms also had surgery based on the amount of esotropia measured, as did the two-fifths
      of the patients who did not undergo prism adaptation.

      Patients were examined postoperatively at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. An
      independent examiner, masked to the treatment assignment, evaluated the patient at the
      6-month followup. The results were analyzed to determine whether the outcome was better in
      patients who underwent prism adaptation or in those who underwent conventional treatment.
      Because the examiner did not know what type of treatment a patient had received, he or she
      would have no bias in evaluating the results.

NCT00000122,Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study (FFSS),National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,"
      To determine whether postoperative subconjunctival injections of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
      increase the success rate of filtering surgery in patients at high risk for failure after
      standard glaucoma filtering surgery.
    ","
      Filtering surgery adequately lowers intraocular pressure in most glaucoma patients. However,
      the prognosis is less favorable for aphakic patients with glaucoma or glaucoma in phakic eyes
      following unsuccessful filtering operations. Failure of filtering surgery is usually
      attributed to the proliferation of fibroblasts at the filtering site. The use of 5-FU, an
      antimetabolite, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of fibroblasts in tissue culture,
      and in preliminary studies it has increased the success of filtering surgery in a nonhuman
      primate model.

      The Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study (FFSS) was a randomized, controlled clinical trial
      comparing the success rate of standard glaucoma filtering surgery to the success rate of
      standard surgery with adjunctive 5-FU treatment.

      Another element of this study was to evaluate the frequency and severity of possible adverse
      effects related to 5-FU injections. Detailed preoperative and postoperative examinations of
      the cornea, lens, and retina were performed. Systemic toxicity was assessed by preoperative
      and postoperative hematologic studies.

      After the investigators performed the filtering surgery and determined that the new outlet
      channel was working, patients were randomized to receive either 5-FU injections or standard
      postsurgical care without 5-FU. The patients treated with 5-FU received subconjunctival
      injections of 5 mg of 5-FU twice daily on postoperative days 1 through 7 and once daily on
      postoperative days 8 through 14. There were 213 patients recruited into the study, 162 with
      previous cataract extraction and 51 with previous filtering surgery.

      All patients were examined at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 18 months, and 2 years
      postoperatively and at yearly intervals thereafter until 5 years postoperatively. Possible
      concomitant risks of 5-FU treatment, such as toxic effects to the cornea, lens, or retina,

      To determine whether there were any predisposing ocular factors that could be used to predict
      which subjects will experience changes or complications.
    ","
      In the early 1960s, a group of clinicians asserted that myopia could be reduced and possibly
      corrected by fitting specially designed contact lenses to induce corneal flattening and
      thereby reduce the refractive power of the eye. This technique, known as orthokeratology,
      required that the lenses be fitted and then changed progressively until vision becomes normal
      or nearly normal. Advocates of orthokeratology claimed that corneal changes could be induced
      in a predictable fashion, were often permanent, and occurred without causing any adverse
      effects to the cornea. Data on orthokeratology were generally limited, poorly documented, and
      did not address the issues of control or failure.

      The Berkeley Orthokeratology Study was a single center randomized, concurrently controlled,
      masked clinical trial. Corneal and visual changes in an orthokeratology treatment group were
      monitored and compared with those observed in a control group whose members wore contact
      lenses fitted in a standard clinical manner. Visual and ocular characteristics were monitored
      for 1.5 years.

      Eighty subjects were studied-40 in an orthokeratology group and 40 in a control group fitted
      with conventional hard contact lenses. The hard lenses chosen for this study were made of
      either polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or a PMMA-silicone combination (Polycon). All subjects
      were initially fitted with PMMA lenses.

      The initial treatment and control lenses were selected according to protocol guidelines and
      then adjusted to achieve an ""optimal fit"" based on lens position, movement, and alignment as
      assessed by fluorescein study. At the outset, the treatment and control lenses differed in
      that the treatment lenses were on the average thicker and flatter and had a larger diameter.

      Following the dispensing visit, subjects progressed through three study phases. In the
      adaption phase (Phase A), subjects were examined weekly until they were adapted to 12 to 14
      hours of daily contact lens wear. The postadaptive phase (Phase B) consisted of monthly
      followup examinations for 1 year. The final phase (Phase C) consisted of a lens withdrawal
      segment and a postwearing segment.

      well as sight-preserving role of radiation therapy.

      To determine which of two standard treatments, removal of the eye or brachytherapy, is more
      likely to prolong survival of eligible patients with medium-sized choroidal melanoma.

      To determine whether preoperative radiation prolongs life for patients whose eyes with large
      choroidal melanoma are enucleated.
    ","
      For more than 100 years, removal of the eye (enucleation) has been the standard treatment for
      choroidal melanoma. Before the COMS was initiated in 1986, interest in radiation therapy had
      increased because of the potential for saving the eye and perhaps some vision. However, the
      merits of radiation with respect to prolonging patient survival were unknown. The best data
      from nonrandomized studies suggested that there was no difference in length of remaining life
      between patients treated with radiation and those whose eyes were enucleated. Thus, it was
      appropriate and necessary to conduct a randomized, controlled clinical trial in which a large
      number of patients would be followed for many years in order to compare enucleation and
      radiation with respect to relative success in prolonging survival of choroidal melanoma
      patients.

      The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) is a set of long-term, multicenter, randomized
      controlled trials. In the trial for patients with tumors of medium size, enucleation and
      irradiation with an iodine-125 episcleral plaque are compared on the basis of length of
      remaining life. All randomized patients will be followed for 5 to 15 years or until death.
      For patients randomly assigned to enucleation, the eye was removed following a standard
      procedure. For patients assigned to plaque irradiation, the margins of the tumor were located
      and the dimensions of the tumor were measured by the ophthalmic surgeon. A gold plaque with a
      plastic seed carrier that contained the proper dosage and configuration of radioactive iodine
      seeds was sutured to the outside (sclera) of the eye over the base of the tumor. This
      procedure made possible the delivery of a high dose of radiation to a very localized area (85
      Gy [TG-43] to the tumor apex). The plaque typically was removed from the eye after three to
      seven days. Enrollment was completed in this trial in July 1998 with 1,317 patients enrolled.
      Clinical follow-up of patients will end in July 2003.

      In the COMS trial of preoperative radiation, patients with large tumors were randomized to
      enucleation alone or to enucleation preceded by 20 Gy of external beam radiation. The two
      randomly assigned groups of patients were followed for at least five years or until death and
      have been compared on the basis of length of remaining life and other outcomes. Enrollment in
      this trial was completed in December 1994, with 1,003 patients enrolled. Clinical follow-up
      of all patients in this trial ended in July 2000.

      Accrual to a nonrandomized pilot study to assess the feasibility of a randomized trial for
      small tumors was halted in 1989. Additional followup of those 204 patients was carried out
      from 1994 to 1996.

      The COMS is conducted in 43 clinical centers located in major population areas of the United
      States and Canada. Six resource centers participate and have major roles in quality assurance
      for the study. Information gathered and analyzed includes time to death from all causes, time
      to death from cancer (whether metastatic choroidal melanoma or not), diagnosis of other
      tumors, complications of radiation, and changes in visual acuity. A parallel study of quality
      of life for patients enrolled in the trial of radioactive plaque was initiated in January
      1995. From November 1986 through July 1998, 8,712 patients with choroidal melanoma of all
      sizes were screened for eligibility for a COMS clinical trial.

      Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United States and other
      industrialized countries. It is estimated that 2 million people in the United States have
      glaucoma and that 80,000 of these individuals are legally blind from the disease. Among
      African Americans, glaucoma is now recognized as the leading cause of blindness.

      Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), a common condition affecting 3 to 6 million people in
      the United States, is thought to be the leading risk factor for development of open-angle
      glaucoma. There is no consensus that medical reduction of intraocular pressure prevents or
      delays the onset of visual field and/or optic nerve damage in ocular hypertensive subjects.

      Despite the lack of convincing evidence for the efficacy of medical treatment in ocular
      hypertension, approximately 1.5 million glaucoma suspects in the United States are being
      treated with costly ocular hypotensive medications that carry the potential for serious and
      even life-threatening side effects.

      Clearly, there is a need for a well-controlled clinical trial to determine whether medical
      reduction of IOP can prevent or delay the onset of glaucomatous damage in ocular hypertensive
      subjects. Only then can clinicians and patients make rational choices and health care
      planners ensure that limited medical resources are being allocated in a safe and
      cost-effective manner.

      The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) is a long-term, randomized, controlled
      multicenter clinical trial. Ocular hypertensive subjects judged to be at moderate risk of
      developing primary open-angle glaucoma are randomly assigned to either close observation only
      or a stepped medical regimen. Medical treatment consists of all commercially available
      topical ocular hypotensive eye drops.

      After completion of baseline measures (IOP, visual fields, disc photos) and randomization,
      the subjects are followed for a minimum of 5 years with automated threshold central static
      perimetry (Humphrey program 30-2) twice yearly and stereoscopic optic disc photographs once
      yearly. Study end points are reproducible visual field loss and/or progressive optic disc
      damage in either eye of a patient attributed to glaucoma by a Masked Endpoint Committee. All
      visual fields and optic disc photographs are read in a masked fashion in Reading Centers.

      In the 1991 Baltimore Eye Survey, African Americans were shown to have a prevalence of
      open-angle glaucoma four to five times higher than whites. Given this high prevalence of
      glaucoma in the African American population, it is important to recruit and follow an
      adequate sample of African American subjects in the trial (approximately 25 percent of the
      total patient sample).

      At the conclusion of this study, practitioners should be able to make reasonable estimates of
      risk for individual ocular hypertensive patients and to determine which ocular hypertensive
      individuals are most likely to benefit from early prophylactic medical treatment.

NCT00000126,Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial Followup (IONDT Followup),National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,"
      To follow all patients enrolled in the original Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial
      (IONDT) to determine (1) the incidence of non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) in
      the second eye, (2) changes in visual acuity over time in both the study and second eye, and
      (3) other aspects of the natural history of NAION.
    ","
      NAION is the most common cause of acute optic nerve disease in the elderly, causing permanent
      and severe visual loss. No proven treatment currently exists to reverse or arrest this loss.
      There is no accepted method for the prevention or reduction of the likelihood of second eye
      involvement. NAION strikes both eyes in as many as 40 percent of affected patients (Beri et
      al. 1987), with a 2-year risk of about 25 percent (Steven Feldon, personal communication to
      SEK).

      IONDT compared optic nerve decompression surgery (ONDS), which was becoming a widely used
      treatment for NAION, with careful followup alone, in patients with newly diagnosed NAION. The
      rationale for the surgery was that NAION was caused by impaired blood flow to the optic nerve
      and that decompression surgery would restore vision by alleviating pressure surrounding the
      nerve. Because ONDS was fast becoming the standard of care, evaluation of the safety and
      efficacy of the procedure was tested in the context of a randomized clinical trial.

      Within 2 years of the start of the IONDT, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee
      recommended cessation of the clinical trial recruitment. The National Institutes of Health
      issued a clinical alert to 25,000 ophthalmologists and neurologists describing the study
      findings that surgery was no better than careful followup and may be harmful (IONDT 1995). It
      was recommended that ONDS not be used in cases of NAION. Thus, the IONDT findings not only
      have led to a costly and ineffective surgery to be abandoned as a treatment for NAION, but
      also have left practitioners with a dearth of treatment choices.

      The IONDT is the first multicenter, prospective study of newly diagnosed patients with NAION.
      The baseline history and examination, which took place within 14 days of the onset of
      symptoms, used standardized methods and diagnostic criteria to collect data on all factors
      possibly relating to the etiology of NAION. In reports from previous studies that present
      data on both initial and final visual acuities, no data are available regarding change in
      visual acuity over time for individual patients. Where data are available on final visual
      acuity, reported rates of improvement are low, ranging from 0 percent to 33 percent for
      untreated eyes. The IONDT found, however, an improvement of three or more lines in 42.7
      percent of patients who received careful followup.

      NAION in both eyes has been reported in as few as 10.5 percent and as many as 73 percent of
      patients. In a study of bilateral NAION where all patients were prospectively logged, Beri et
      al. reported that 17.5 percent of patients developed bilateral disease at 1 year of followup
      and 34.5 percent developed it at 5 years. However, Beck et al., using a life table analysis
      on the same cohort reported by Beri et al., estimated the risk of bilateral NAION to be 12
      percent within 2 years and 19 percent within 5 years. The IONDT has so far similarly reported
      a 12 percent (25/216) incidence of bilateral NAION in its randomized patients. The incidence
      in the nonrandomized group, 91 percent of whom had visual acuity better than 20/64, is much
      lower at 4 percent (5/136).

      Thus, continued followup of the IONDT cohort is critically important to ascertain a clear
      picture of the natural history of NAION in terms of involvement of the second eye and
      long-term vision. Data obtained will be critical in understanding the etiology of the disease
      and in generating hypotheses for testing further treatments for the disease.

      The IONDT Followup Study will continue to monitor vision and other health outcomes in
      patients originally enrolled in the IONDT, whether randomized to one of the two treatment
      groups or whether followed as part of the natural history cohort. All IONDT patients were
      diagnosed with NAION within 14 days of onset of symptoms, have had a minimum of 2 years of
      continuous followup, and will be followed for an additional 4 years in the Followup Study.
      Patients will have annual visits at the original IONDT Clinical Center or, if necessary, with
      a surrogate provider. If NAION occurs in the second eye, the patient will be asked to visit
      the clinic for a special visit. The Coordinating Center will telephone the patients on a
      quarterly basis, between annual visits. Outcomes that will be examined include:

        -  incidence of NAION in the second eye,

        -  medical or ocular events surrounding the occurrence of NAION,

        -  visual acuity (measured using the New York Lighthouse charts).

      In the event of an NAION event in the second eye, the patient's visual field will be tested
      by using the Humphrey Perimeter.

      To assess the safety and efficacy of optic nerve sheath decompression surgery for
      non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).
    ","
      Non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), the most common cause of acute optic nerve
      disease in older persons, causes permanent and severe visual loss. Visual function can be
      impaired through decreased central visual acuity or peripheral field loss, or both. NAION
      strikes both eyes in up to 40 percent of affected patients. The incidence of NAION has been
      estimated at 2.3 per 100,000 persons over the age of 50 years and 0.54 per 100,000 for all
      ages. Estimates of the number of new cases seen each year in the United States range from a
      low of approximately 1,500 to a high of 6,000.

      NAION has been hypothesized to be caused by vascular insufficiency leading to optic nerve
      head ischemia. There is general agreement that NAION results from transient non-perfusion of
      nutrient vessels. The wide range of visual field defects and visual loss with NAION can be
      explained by the extent and number of the blood vessels involved.

      Anatomical factors appear to contribute to the vascular event initiating NAION. Clinically,
      the number of discs congenitally lacking a physiological cup in eyes with NAION is higher
      than expected. Presumably, in eyes with NAION, these discs have small scleral openings that
      crowd the nerve fibers as they pass through the restricted space in the optic disc and lamina
      cribrosa, thereby predisposing to an ischemic spiral.

      One current theory holds that NAION begins as a minor ischemic event that later progresses to
      a major infarction due to congenitally anomalous optic nerves. The inciting ischemic event
      leads to local anterior nerve edema, and this causes further ischemia.

      Optic nerve sheath decompression surgery was reported in 1989 to be of benefit to patients
      with NAION. The presumed mechanism of action in optic nerve decompression surgery revolved
      around restoration of impaired blood flow to the optic nerve through reduction of the
      pressure around the nerve.

      The Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial (IONDT) was a randomized clinical trial
      designed to compare the improvements in visual acuity at 6 months in patients assigned to
      receive surgery with optic nerve sheath decompression with those assigned to careful
      followup. A cohort of patients, with a baseline visual acuity of better than 20/64 are also
      being followed to better understand the natural history of the disease, including second eye
      involvement.

      Enrollment began in October 1992. Randomization was stratified by clinic, and patients had an
      equal probability of assignment to surgery or careful followup. All patients are being
      followed for a minimum of 2 years.

      The primary outcome is a change of three lines or more in visual acuity at the 6-month
      followup visit compared with visual acuity measured at the randomization visit.

      Secondary outcomes include a change in visual acuity beyond 6 months, change in peripheral
      visual function as measured by automated Humphrey perimetry, local and systemic side effects
      from treatment, change in quality of life, and other associated morbidity and mortality.

NCT00000128,A Trial of Bifocals in Myopic Children With Esophoria,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,"
      To test the hypothesis that correction with bifocal spectacle lenses rather than
      single-vision lenses will slow the progression of myopia in children with near-point
      esophoria. The primary outcome variable is cycloplegic refraction as measured with an
      automated refractor. Axial length is measured with ultrasound in order to test the corollary
      hypothesis that use of bifocals will slow ocular growth in these myopic children. We will
      also examine the amount of close work performed by subjects and the degree of parental myopia
      as factors that may influence myopia progression.
    ","
      About 25 percent of all persons in the United States are myopic. The most common form of
      myopia is childhood myopia, which begins after age 6 and progresses rapidly until age 16.
      Myopia progression results from excessive growth of the eye, primarily by enlargement of the
      vitreous chamber. Excessive elongation of the eye is a major risk factor for retinal
      detachment.

      Previous prospective studies failed to show that use of bifocals was effective in slowing
      myopia progression. However, these studies did not separate subjects by near-point phoria
      before randomization. Retrospective studies by David Goss indicated that bifocals slowed
      myopia progression by almost 50 percent in children with near-point esophoria but had no
      effect on children with exophoria.

      A small, prospective pilot study, completed by the investigators of this trial, also
      supported the hypothesis that bifocals slow myopia progression in children with near-point
      esophoria. Thirty-two myopic children, all of whom showed near-point esophoria, were enrolled
      in this 18-month study. Twenty-eight children completed the study, with 14 randomized into
      bifocals and 14 into single-vision lenses. Cycloplegic automated refraction was performed
      every 6 months. Over the course of the whole study, there was a small, statistically
      insignificant difference in the rates of myopia progression: 0.57 diopters per year (D/yr)
      (S.E. = 0.11) for those in single-vision lenses compared with 0.36 D/yr (S.E. = 0.12) for
      those in bifocals (p = 0.26).

      However, significant seasonal effects in myopia progression were demonstrated, and the
      results also suggested that the beneficial effects of bifocals may take several months to
      develop. During the first 6 months, which included most of the school year, myopia
      progression was rapid in both the bifocal group (0.61 D/yr) and the single-vision group (0.68
      D/yr). During the second 6 months, which included all of the summer vacation, myopia
      progression was slow in both groups, 0.32 and 0.26 D/yr for bifocal wearers and single-vision
      wearers, respectively. During the last 6 months, i.e., the second school year, myopia
      progressed slowly in the bifocal wearers (0.37 D/yr) but rapidly (0.80 D/yr) in single-vision
      wearers. A repeated-measure analysis of variance demonstrated a significant seasonal effect
      (p < 0.002) and a significant interaction between season and type of correction (p < 0.043).

      The apparent effectiveness of bifocals in children with near-point esophoria and the lack of
      effectiveness in other children may be explained by a greater lag of accommodation in
      children with esophoria. This lag might cause a slightly blurred retinal image that the
      bifocal may sharpen. Other mechanisms might also be involved.

      Eighty or more myopic children, all with near-point esophoria as measured at baseline with
      von Graefe prisms through a current myopic correction placed in a phoropter, will be randomly
      assigned to wear either single-vision spectacle lenses or lenses with +1.50 D add in a
      flat-top 28-mm segment. Subjects will visit one of two sites, either a private optometry
      practice in Tulsa or the optometry clinic at Northeastern State University, every 6 months.
      Data collected at each visit will include automated refraction after cycloplegia with 1
      percent tropicamide, biometry with A-scan, and estimates of the amount of study and other
      close work by means of questionnaires administered to the subjects and their parents. We will
      also obtain measures of the degree of myopia in the biological parents. The myopic correction
      will be changed if the spherical component of the refraction in either eye has changed by 0.5
      diopter or more or if any change in cylinder power or axis improves vision in either eye by
      three letters or more. The study will continue for 30 months and will include six visits by
      each subject.

      To determine the long-term safety and efficacy of the procedure.
    ","
      Approximately 11 million Americans have myopia that can be corrected with eyeglasses or
      contact lenses. Some of these people may also be candidates for radial keratotomy (RK), a
      procedure that aims to correct or reduce myopia by surgery that flattens the corneal
      curvature.

      Keratotomy was first performed by surgeons in Europe and the United States in the late 1800s,
      and the basic optical and mechanical principles of the operation were defined in the 1940s
      and 1950s by the Japanese doctors T. Sato and K. Akiyama, who used anterior and posterior
      corneal incisions. The posterior incisions damaged the cornea, and the procedure was modified
      in the Soviet Union by doctors Fyodorov and V. Durnev to include incisions in only the
      anterior cornea. Since its introduction into the United States in 1978, numerous
      ophthalmologists have modified the procedure by introducing technical and surgical
      improvements such as ultrasonic methods to measure the thickness of the cornea and the use of
      diamond-bladed micrometer knives to make the incisions.

      However, scientific assessment of RK lagged behind growing public and professional interest
      in the procedure. In 1980, in response to widespread concern about the long-term safety and
      efficacy of RK, a group of ophthalmic surgeons approached the National Eye Institute with a
      proposal for a multicenter clinical trial that would evaluate the potential benefits and
      risks of this procedure.

      The Prospective Evaluation of Radial Keratotomy study, involving 435 patients and 99 pilot
      patients, was a clinical trial designed to evaluate the short- and long-term safety and
      efficacy of one technique of radial keratotomy. The procedure was evaluated by comparing a
      patient's refractive error and uncorrected vision before and after surgery. The more myopic
      eye received surgery first. Patients were required to wait 1 year before having the operation
      on the second eye.

      The surgical technique was standardized, consisting of eight centrifugal radial incisions
      made manually with a diamond micrometer knife. The diameter of the central, uncut, clear zone
      was determined by the preoperative spherical equivalent cycloplegic refraction (-2.00 to
      -3.12 D = 4.0 mm; -3.25 to -4.3 D = 3.5 mm; -4.50 to -8.00 D = 3.0 mm). The blade length,
      which determined the depth of the incision, was set at 100 percent of the thinnest of four
      intraoperative ultrasonic corneal thickness readings taken paracentrally at the 3-, 6-, 9-,
      and 12-o'clock meridians just outside the mark delineating the clear zone. The incisions were
      made from the edge of the trephine mark to the limbal vascular arcade and were spaced
      equidistantly around the cornea.

      Patients were examined preoperatively and after surgery at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months,
      annually for 5 years, and at 10 years. Examinations in the morning and evening of the same
      day were done at 3 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 11 years in a subset of the patients to test
      for diurnal fluctuation of vision and refraction.

      The primary outcome variables measured at each visit was the uncorrected and
      spectacle-corrected visual acuity and the refractive error with the pupil dilated and
      undilated. The corneal shape was measured with central keratometry and photokeratoscopy.
      Endothelial function was evaluated using specular microscopy. A slit-lamp microscope
      examination was made to check for complications from the incisions. Contrast sensitivity was
      tested in a subset of patients. Patient motivation and satisfaction were studied with
      psychometric questionnaires at baseline, 1 year, 5-6 years, and 10 years.

      To determine which factors, other than treatment, predict outcome in postoperative bacterial
      endophthalmitis.
    ","
      Endophthalmitis is a serious ocular infection that can result in blindness. Approximately 70
      percent of cases occur as a direct complication of intraocular surgery. Current management
      requires culture of intraocular contents and administration of an antibiotic. Vitrectomy
      surgery, which may help to manage endophthalmitis by removing infecting organisms and their
      toxins, has been shown to be of value in various animal models of endophthalmitis. However,
      human studies have not shown an advantage to vitrectomy with intraocular antibiotics compared
      with intraocular antibiotics alone.

      In all large comparison studies to date, eyes with the worst initial presentations were the
      ones selected for vitrectomy. Because of the selection bias involved in determining which
      cases received vitrectomy, existing clinical information on the efficacy of the procedure for
      treating endophthalmitis is inconclusive. Determining the role of initial vitrectomy and the
      benefit or lack of benefit to certain subgroups of patients will help the clinician in the
      management of endophthalmitis.

      In addition, although systemic antibiotics have long been used in the management of
      endophthalmitis, there has been little evidence to support their efficacy, but there have
      been many reports of toxic systemic effects. In view of this, the role of systemic
      antibiotics in the management of endophthalmitis will be assessed.

      Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study (EVS) patients were randomized to one of two standard
      treatment strategies for the management of bacterial endophthalmitis. Eyes received either
      (1) initial pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotics, followed by retap and
      reinjection at 36-60 hours for eyes that did poorly as defined in the study or (2) initial
      anterior chamber and vitreous tap/biopsy with injection of intravitreal antibiotics, followed
      by vitrectomy and reinjection at 36-60 hours in eyes doing poorly. In addition, all eyes were
      randomized to either treatment or no treatment with intravenous antibiotics.

      Study end points were visual acuity and clarity of ocular media, the latter assessed both
      clinically and photographically. Each patient's initial end point assessment occurred at 3
      months, after which procedures to improve vision, such as late vitrectomy for nonclearing
      ocular media, were an option. The final outcome assessment occurred at 9 months. Multiple
      centers cooperated by enrolling 420 eyes during the 42-month recruitment period.

    ","
      Central vein occlusion is a common retinal vascular disorder with potentially blinding
      complications. The two major complications are reduced central vision caused by macular edema
      and neovascular glaucoma caused by iris neovascularization. Other clinical trials have shown
      that laser photocoagulation is an effective treatment for complications found in diabetic
      retinopathy and branch vein occlusion, which have some features in common with CVO:
      neovascularization and reduced visual acuity caused by macular edema occur in all three
      disorders. Evidence from small-scale studies suggests that a grid pattern of photocoagulation
      reduces macular edema in CVO patients, although the associated changes in visual acuity are
      variable. The CVOS is a detailed investigation of grid pattern photocoagulation in a larger
      randomized group of patients.

      Eligible patients were divided into four groups:

      Group N: Eyes with extensive retinal ischemia (at least 10 disc areas of nonperfusion) were
      randomly assigned to receive panretinal photocoagulation or nontreatment unless iris
      neovascularization developed.

      Group M: Eyes with visual loss ascribable to macular edema were randomly assigned to receive
      grid-pattern photocoagulation or nontreatment.

      Group P: Eyes with relatively perfused retinas were followed to provide information about the
      natural history of the disease.

      Group I: Indeterminate eyes in which the retina could not be visualized accurately because of
      hemorrhage were followed in a natural history study.

      Green argon laser with a slit lamp delivery system was used for all treatments. Photographic
      documentation of retinal changes was obtained at entry, post-treatment, and at specified
      followup visits for a period of at least 3 years. The frequency of followup visits varied
      according to the group to which the CVO patient was assigned. Visual acuity, the primary
      outcome factor in the group with macular edema, was measured according to a modified Early
      Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study protocol at each visit.

      The secondary purposes are to determine the extent of IOP reduction attained by treatment, to
      explore factors that may influence glaucoma progression, and to describe the natural history
      of newly detected glaucoma.
    ","
      Glaucoma is a common disease in older adults. All present treatment aims at reduction of the
      intraocular pressure, but indications for therapy are not well defined. Furthermore, it is
      unclear whether intraocular pressure influences the natural history of glaucoma. Against this
      background, the primary aim of the study is of central importance to patients with manifest
      and suspect glaucoma.

      Glaucoma has few subjective symptoms during a long period early in the disease, but damage is
      irreversible once it occurs. Early diagnosis and rapid detection of progression are of
      paramount importance in limiting this damage, whether through pressure reduction or in some
      other way. The effectiveness, if any, of lowering the intraocular pressure in glaucoma
      requires evaluation by controlled treatment trials.

      The Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT) is the first large, controlled, randomized clinical
      trial to evaluate the effect of lowering the intraocular pressure on the progression of newly
      detected, open-angle glaucoma. This study will compare glaucoma progression in initially
      treated versus untreated patients with newly detected open-angle glaucoma and will allow
      quantification of the effect of immediate IOP-lowering treatment on progression during the
      followup period.

      The EMGT is a collaborative effort that involves a Clinical Center at the Department of
      Ophthalmology of Malmo University Hospital at the University of Lund, Sweden, and its
      Satellite Center in Helsingborg, Sweden; an independent Data Center at the Department of
      Preventive Medicine, University Medical Center at Stony Brook, New York; and a Disc

      Lund. The study was initiated with support from the Swedish Medical Research Council.

      Recruitment for the study has been completed. The 255 patients were identified by an
      extensive, population-based screening of successive age cohorts as well as by clinical
      referral. The diagnosis was confirmed through Humphrey perimetry at two postscreening visits
      to the Clinical Center or Satellite Center. Eligible patients who agreed to participate had
      two additional visits for collection of baseline data. They were randomized to treatment with
      the beta blocker Betaxolol and argon laser trabeculoplasty (treated group) or to no initial
      treatment (control group) with close followup of both groups.

      Patients are followed for a minimum of 4 years to assess the development of glaucoma
      progression. They are seen every 3 months to collect visual field, IOP, and other data. Disc
      photographs are taken every 6 months. Technicians and disc photograph graders are masked
      regarding treatment assignment. Additional followup visits are held to confirm visual field
      progression and IOP elevation (>25 mm Hg in treated group, >35 mm Hg in control group).
      Patients in the treated group receive Xalantan whenever IOP exceeds 25 mm Hg at more than one
      visit; patients in the control group will receive Xalantan whenever IOP reaches 35 mm Hg or
      higher during the trial. If IOP remains high, individualized treatment is given. All patients
      continue to be followed to monitor the development of end points and will be analyzed in
      their originally assigned groups.

      The study outcome is glaucoma progression, which is based on specific criteria derived from
      analyses of Humphrey visual fields and masked evaluations of disc photographs. The perimetric
      outcome is defined as statistically significant deterioration (p < 0.05) of the same three or
      more test points in Pattern Deviation Change Probability Maps in three consecutive C30-2
      Humphrey fields. Optic disc progression is determined by the following:

        -  The presence of definite change (detected by comparison of followup photographs with
           baseline) by flicker chronoscopy in two followup photographs from the same visit, with
           independent confirmation by side-by-side gradings.

        -  Final confirmation of change toward progression, by flicker chronoscopy and by
           side-by-side gradings, at a different followup visit.

NCT00000133,Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity (CRYO-ROP) - Outcome Study of Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,"
      To determine the safety and efficacy of trans-scleral cryotherapy of the peripheral retina in
      certain low birth-weight infants with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) for reducing blindness
      from ROP.

      To determine the long-term outcome for eyes that had severe (""threshold"") ROP, both with and
      without cryotherapy.
    ","
      ROP is a disease of the eyes of prematurely born infants in which the retinal blood vessels
      increase in number and branch excessively, sometimes leading to hemorrhage or scarring.
      Before the establishment of this study in 1985, more than 500 infants annually were blinded
      by ROP in the United States alone.

      More than 30 years ago, the National Institutes of Health sponsored a clinical trial that
      showed that if premature babies are given oxygen only as needed, the number of infants who
      develop ROP drops dramatically. Subsequently, hospitals cut back on giving excessive oxygen
      routinely to premature babies. But, with improvements in neonatal care over the last two
      decades, the number of babies at risk is increasing as survival rates for smaller premature
      infants improve. The lower the birth weight, the higher the incidence and severity of ROP.

      In a more recent NEI-supported study at the University of Miami, blood oxygen levels of very
      low birth-weight infants were monitored continuously by use of transcutaneous measurements as
      long as oxygen therapy was needed. The study showed that there is no statistically
      significant difference between the rates of ROP in infants monitored on continuous oxygen
      therapy and in those monitored only when they were receiving oxygen in excess of 40 percent.

      The Supplemental Therapeutic Oxygen for Prethreshold ROP (STOP-ROP) trial, also funded by the
      NEI, studied whether a slight increase in oxygen therapy would prevent the progression of
      moderate ROP to ROP severe enough to require surgical treatment. This intervention made
      little or no difference in outcomes.

      Likewise, another NEI-sponsored clinical trial (LIGHT-ROP) demonstrated absence of protective
      effect on ROP by limiting light exposure to newborn premature infants. These studies have led
      to the conclusion that factors other than oxygen or light exposure must be involved in
      causing ROP.

      In most infants who develop ROP, the disease spontaneously subsides, permitting development
      of normal vision. But other infants who progress to a severe form of ROP are in danger of
      becoming permanently blind. Although the cause of ROP is not fully explained, scientists are
      seeking ways to treat ROP successfully and to find the right time in the progression of the
      disease to use treatment. Cryotherapy, which destroys the fringe of the retina through
      freezing, is the only treatment so far that has been demonstrated to provide substantial
      benefit to these eyes.

      The multicenter trial of cryotherapy for ROP enrolled more than 4,000 premature infants who
      weighed no more than 1,250 grams at birth. This category of infants is at the greatest risk
      of developing ROP. The eyes of the infants enrolled in the study were examined at
      predetermined intervals while the subjects were still in the intensive care nursery. After
      the pupils were dilated with eye drops, the eyes were examined by an ophthalmologist using a
      binocular indirect ophthalmoscope to visualize the developing retina. The natural history of
      the condition of each infant's retina was recorded. When examination disclosed the severe
      form of ROP (threshold ROP) in both eyes, and the parents gave informed consent, one of the
      infant's eyes was randomly selected to receive cryotherapy. In this technique, a cryoprobe
      was used to freeze and thus destroy the peripheral extent of the retina, thereby arresting
      the development of the blood vessels growing wildly toward it.

      Outcome of the therapy was assessed at 3 months and 12 months following randomization by an
      extensive examination that included photography of the interior of both the treated and the
      control eyes. The 12-month exam also measured visual function with preferential-looking
      techniques. Such measurements allowed correlations between fundus photographs and visual
      function and a comparison of visual function for treated versus control eyes. Neither the
      trained photograph readers who evaluated the pictures from both eyes nor the specially
      trained vision testers knew which eyes had received cryotherapy. Additional assessments of
      visual acuity and retinal status have been made approximately each year up to the present.
      Currently (2001), preparations are being made for a 15-year outcome study that will conclude
      by 2003.

NCT00000134,Studies of the Ocular Complications of AIDS (SOCA)--Cytomegalovirus Retinitis Retreatment Trial (CRRT),Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,Other,"
      To compare the relative merits of three therapeutic regimens in patients with AIDS and CMV
      retinitis who have been previously treated but whose retinitis either is nonresponsive or has
      relapsed. These three therapeutic regimens were (1) foscarnet, (2) high-dose ganciclovir, and
      (3) combination foscarnet and ganciclovir.

      To compare two treatment strategies in patients with relapsed or nonresponsive CMV retinitis:
      (1) continuing the same anti-CMV drug or (2) switching to the alternate drug.
    ","
      CMV retinitis is the most common intraocular infection in patients with AIDS and is estimated
      to affect 35 to 40 percent of patients with AIDS. Untreated CMV retinitis is a progressive
      disorder, the end result of which is total retinal destruction and blindness. At the time of
      this trial, drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of CMV retinitis were ganciclovir (Cytovene) and foscarnet (Foscavir). Although
      most retinitis responds well to initial therapy with systemically administered drugs, given
      enough time, nearly all patients will suffer a relapse of the retinitis. Relapsed retinitis
      generally responds to reinduction and maintenance therapy, but the interval between
      successive relapses progressively shortens. The CRRT addressed the issue of the management of
      relapsed CMV retinitis.

      The CRRT was a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing three regimens in
      patients with relapsed retinitis. Patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis that had relapsed or
      was nonresponsive to initial therapy were randomized to one of three regimens: (1)
      intravenous foscarnet reinduction at 90 mg/kg twice daily for 2 weeks, followed by
      maintenance therapy at 120 mg/kg/day; (2) intravenous ganciclovir reinduction at 5 mg/kg
      twice daily for 2 weeks followed by maintenance at 10 mg/kg/day; and (3) combination therapy,
      wherein patients continued their previous therapy and were reinduced with the second drug and
      then placed on maintenance therapy with foscarnet at 90 mg/kg/day and ganciclovir at 5
      mg/kg/day.
